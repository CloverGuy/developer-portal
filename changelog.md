# Technical Changes

## 6/7/2020
### Added Mainnet Contracts

## 29/6/2020
### (Hopefully) Final Version

Minor fixes due to audit comments from ChainSecurity.
- Removed unnecessary import in KyberDao.sol
- Revert comment fixes for better clarity
- Added token parameter to events emitted by KyberFeeHandler
- Added MAX_ALLOWANCE variable, use `2**256 - 1` instead of `2**255` due to COMP token implementation

### Claim rewards from kyberFeeHandler
As we plan for post-Katalyst, we foresee supporting different quote tokens (such as stablecoins) instead of just ether. This means that network fees collected will potentially be in these quote tokens as well. As a result, there may be multiple feeHandlers to claim rewards from. 

We have thus made the following changes:
- The `claimStakerReward` function has moved from `kyberDao` to `kyberFeeHandler`. Now, the `kyberFeeHandler` contract will fetch the staker's reward percentage from the `kyberDao`.
- `kyberFeeHandler` has been removed from `kyberDao`
- `claimStakerReward` will not revert if reward is zero, or if a staker has already claimed his reward
- The token address parameter has been added to the `RewardPaid`, `RebatePaid`, `PlatformFeePaid` and `KncBurned` events in `kyberFeeHandler`

If you are buidling on top of the Kyber DAO contracts, we recommend that you plan for receiving staker rewards in ERC20 tokens as well.

### Added more functions to interfaces
- Added `getCurrentEpochNumber` and `getEpochNumber` to IEpochUtils (inherited by IKyberStaking and IKyberDao)
- Added `getStakerData` and `getLatestStakerData` to IKyberStaking

### Variable name change from `delegatedAddress` to `representative`
- `delegatedAddress` has been renamed to `representative`
- `getLatestDelegatedAddress` has been renamed to `getLatestRepresentative`
