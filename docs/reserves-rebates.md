## What are reserve rebates?

A network fee may be charged for a Kyber trade, depending on the reserve type. The network fee percentage is determined on the KyberDAO, and may change over time.

The KyberDAO also gets to determine what happens to the network fee. It is split 3 ways:
1. Burning of KNC
2. Staker rewards
3. Reserve Rebates

The motivation for reserve rebates is to reward selected reserves based on their performance (i.e. amount of trade volume they facilitate). This incentivizes reserves to provide better liquidity and tighter spreads, thereby driving greater volume, value, and network fees.

## How do I specify the reserve rebate wallet for these rebates?
Whenever a reserve is added to the network, the rebate wallet must also be specified as well.

## What if I need to change the rebate wallet address?
Notify the Kyber team / network maintainers!

## Do the rebates go automatically to the rebate wallet I specified?
