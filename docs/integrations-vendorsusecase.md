Kyber's protocol implementation empowers businesses and their users with greater flexibility and variety through seamless token swaps, enabling customers and vendors to pay and receive payments in their token of choice â€“ all within a single transaction.

The following diagram indicates how interacting with Kyber's protocol implementation can enhance the experience for your users.

Projects such as EDCON and Hodlmoon will be taking advantage of Kyber's protocol implementation to allow for payments in a wide range of tokens and currencies.

Vendors also have the opportunity to incorporate a commission fee into each payment originating from their business. Learn more about platform fees [here](integrations-platformfees.md)!

## Integrate Your Platform
The common methods existing vendors use to integrate with our protocol implementation are the **widgets** and **plugins**. Explore the [widgets](integrations-kyberwidgetguide.md) and [plugins](integrations-woocommercepluginguide.md) guides to learn more!
