### Things to note
#### `network`
- `test` and `ropsten` runs on the Ethereum Ropsten network (ie. they are equivalent)
- `production` and `mainnet` runs on the Ethereum mainnet.

#### `productName`
- Multiple product instances are only supported on v0.6+

#### `productQty`
- If this field is used, there must be a corresponding `productName` parameter preceding it. Otherwise, it will be ignored.

#### `productImage`
- `productAvatar` is an alias for `productImage` in older versions (< v0.6)
- If this field is used, there must be a corresponding `productName` parameter preceding it. Otherwise, it will be ignored.

### FAQ

1. Even though I specified the popup / iframe mode, why does the browser open the widget in a new tab when the user clicks on the payment button?

**Answer:**

If your buttons do not have the ‘kyber-widget-button’ class, or they are generated on the fly when the page is already loaded, you need to manually activate the buttons as such:

```javascript
window.kyberWidgetOptions.register(‘your buttons CSS selector here’);
```
If you don’t provide the CSS selector, it defaults to ‘kyber-widget-button’.

2. How do I track or monitor the payment status?

**Answer:**
Kindly refer to [this monitoring PHP library](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/widget-monitor-php). More monitoring tools may be built by Kyber and the community in the future. Alternatively, vendors can choose to implement and run their own monitoring logic to get the payment status from the Ethereum network.
