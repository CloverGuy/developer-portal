# Voting APIs

## Introduction
The kyberDao contract primarily provides the following functionalities:
- Creation and cancellation of campaigns by authorized personnel (namely, the `daoOperator`)
- Voting for campaigns

For stakers and pool operators, the actions you will be interested in are:
1. [Viewing Campaign Details](#reading-campaign-information)
2. [Voting for a campaign](#voting-for-campaigns)

 The [voting formula](#voting-formula) used for deciding the winning options of a campaign may also be of interest.

## Creation and cancellation of campaigns
These actions can only be carried out by the `daoOperator`.

## Campaign Types
There are currently 3 different types of campaigns:
1. `GENERAL`: A generic campaign. 
2. `NETWORK_FEE`: The fee amount (in basis points) to be charged for every trade.
3. `FEE_HANDLER_BRR`: Proportion of fees to be **burnt**, given to stakers as **rewards**, and given to reserves as **rebates** for liquidity contribution.

Note that there can only be a maximum of 1 campaign per epoch for the `NETWORK_FEE` and `FEE_HANDLER_RR` campaign types.

## Voting Formula
The formula was designed to be simple enough such that it can be implemented on-chain, and is gas efficient for calculations. Hence, the "1 token 1 vote" idea is used for its simplicity. A quorum is also defined, in order for a winning option to be considered valid.

The quorum needed is linearly inversely proportional to the percentage of votes received for that campaign. In other words, fewer votes received, stricter quorum. 

In the event that there is more than 1 winning option (ie. more than 1 option sharing the same no. of votes), the campaign is considered to not have a winner.

### Quick Primer
A line can be expressed as `Y = tX + C`, where `t` is the gradient, and `C` shifts the line vertically up/down.

### Variables
- `winningOption`: Campaign option that received the most votes
- `totalVotes`: Total amount of votes received for a campaign
- `votedPercentage`: Percentage of votes (out of the total KNC supply at the time of the campaign)
- `minThreshold`: Minimum percentage (out of all campaign votes) needed for the winning option to be valid

### Explanation
1. We first find `winningOption` with a simple iteration through the votes received by each option.
2. Calculate `votedPercentage`: `totalVotes` / total KNC supply at time of campaign
3. `minThreshold`: `-t * votedPercentage + C`. `t` and `C` were determined by `daoOperator` upon campaign initialisation (to allow for flexibility). Rearranging this, we get `minThreshold = C - t * votedPercentage`
4. If enough people have voted such that `t * votedPercentage > C` (ie. `minThreshold < 0`), then the quorum condition has been met, and we can consider `winningOption` to be valid.
5. Otherwise, we have to check that `winningOption >= minThreshold` before considering it to be a valid winning option.

## Public Dao Variables
- `MAX_EPOCH_CAMPAIGNS`: Maximum number of campaigns that can be created in an epoch by `daoOperator`
- `MAX_CAMPAIGN_OPTIONS`: Maximum number of options that a campaign can have
- `minCampaignDurationInSeconds`: Minimum duration for a campaign
- `kncToken`: The KNC token contract
- `staking`: The staking contract
- `numberCampaigns`: Number of campaigns in total, used to generate a unique ID for each campaign

## Getting Current Epoch Number
Obtain the current epoch number of the Dao contract

---
function **`getCurrentEpochNumber`**() public view returns (uint)

#### Example
```js
// DISCLAIMER: Code snippets in this guide are just examples and you
// should always do your own testing. If you have questions, visit our
// https://t.me/KyberDeveloper
let currentEpochNum = await daoContract.getCurrentEpochNumber().call();
```


## `NETWORK_FEE` Campaign Information
While this section is specific to the `NETWORK_FEE` campaign type, the other sections below are of relevance.

### `networkFeeCampaigns`
`networkFeeCampaigns[epoch] = uint`
`NETWORK_FEE` campaign ID number for a given epoch. Note that there can only be a maximum of 1 `NETWORK_FEE` campaign per epoch.

#### Example
Get the `NETWORK_FEE` campaign ID number for epoch `5`.
```js
// DISCLAIMER: Code snippets in this guide are just examples and you
// should always do your own testing. If you have questions, visit our
// https://t.me/KyberDeveloper

let epochNum = new BN(5);
let result = await daoContract.methods.networkFeeCampaigns(epochNum).call();
```

### `getLatestNetworkFeeData`
Gets the network fee (in basis points) charged for trades, and the timestamp for which it expires.

---
function **getLatestNetworkFeeData`**() public view returns(uint feeInBps, uint expiryTimestamp)

**Returns:**
| Parameter | Type | Description |
| ---------- |:-------:|:-------------------:|
| `feeInBps` | `uint` | Network fee (in basis points) to be charged for trades |
| `expiryTimestamp` | `uint` | Time which the network fee becomes invalid |
---
**Notes:**
- Unlike the `getLatestNetworkFeeDataWithCache()` function below, this is a `view` function, and does not cache the data

#### Example
```js
// DISCLAIMER: Code snippets in this guide are just examples and you
// should always do your own testing. If you have questions, visit our
// https://t.me/KyberDeveloper
let result = await daoContract.methods.getLatestNetworkFeeData().call();
```

### `getLatestNetworkFeeDataWithCache`
In addition to reading the latest network fee data, it concludes the network fee campaign if necessary, thereby caching the data as well.

---
function **getLatestNetworkFeeDataWithCache`**() public returns(uint feeInBps, uint expiryTimestamp)

**Returns:**
| Parameter | Type | Description |
| ---------- |:-------:|:-------------------:|
| `feeInBps` | `uint` | Network fee (in basis points) to be charged for trades |
| `expiryTimestamp` | `uint` | Time which the network fee becomes invalid |
---
**Notes:**
- Unlike the `getLatestNetworkFeeData()` function above, the network fee data is cached as well.

#### Example
```js
// DISCLAIMER: Code snippets in this guide are just examples and you
// should always do your own testing. If you have questions, visit our
// https://t.me/KyberDeveloper
let txData = daoContract.methods.getLatestNetworkFeeDataWithCache().encodeABI();

let txReceipt = await web3.eth.sendTransaction({
  from: USER_WALLET_ADDRESS, // obtained from web3 interface
  to: daoContract.address,
  data: txData
});
```


## `FEE_HANDLER_BRR` Campaign Information

### `brrCampaigns`
`brrCampaigns[epoch] = uint`
`FEE_HANDLER_BRR` campaign ID number for a given epoch. Note that there can only be a maximum of 1 `FEE_HANDLER_BRR` campaign per epoch.

#### Example
Get the `FEE_HANDLER_BRR` campaign ID number for epoch `5`.
```js
// DISCLAIMER: Code snippets in this guide are just examples and you
// should always do your own testing. If you have questions, visit our
// https://t.me/KyberDeveloper

let epochNum = new BN(5);
let result = await daoContract.methods.brrCampaigns(epochNum).call();
```

### `getLatestBRRData`
Gets the latest BRR distribution for the network fee, and the timestamp for which it expires.

---
function **getLatestBRRData()** public returns (uint burnInBps, uint rewardInBps, uint rebateInBps, uint epoch, uint expiryTimestamp)

- Unlike the `getLatestBRRDataWithCache()` function below, this is a `view` function, and does not cache the data

#### Example
```js
// DISCLAIMER: Code snippets in this guide are just examples and you
// should always do your own testing. If you have questions, visit our
// https://t.me/KyberDeveloper
let result = await daoContract.methods.getLatestBRRData().call();
```

### `getLatestBRRDataWithCache`
In addition to reading the latest BRR data, it also concludes a BRR campaign if necessary, thereby caching the latest BRR data as well.

---
function **getLatestBRRDataWithCache()** public returns (uint burnInBps, uint rewardInBps, uint rebateInBps, uint epoch, uint expiryTimestamp)

**Returns:**

- Unlike the `getLatestBRRData()` function above, this function caches the BRR data too.

#### Example
```js
// DISCLAIMER: Code snippets in this guide are just examples and you
// should always do your own testing. If you have questions, visit our
// https://t.me/KyberDeveloper
let txData = daoContract.methods.getLatestBRRDataWithCache().encodeABI();

  from: USER_WALLET_ADDRESS, // obtained from web3 interface
  to: daoContract.address,
  data: txData
});
